# About
A (QT-based) mathematical workspace which allows for evaluating algebraic expressions

# Features
+ Matrices and complex numbers
+ All the operators & functions you think of when you think of a standard calculator
  + `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`/`mod`, `^`
  + `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, etc.
  + other common functions like `sqrt`, `cbrt`, `ln`, etc.
+ Allows lexical substitution of common and user-defined constants
  + `pi`, `e`, `i`, `c`, `h` and `hbar`, `N_A` (Avogadro's number), `R` (molar gas constant, `N_A * k`), `k` (Boltzmann constant)
  + `a = 3+3` defines a new constant `a` with the value `6`
